This repo contains my writeups for [16-726 Generative Image
Synthesis](https://learning-image-synthesis.github.io/sp24/)


Most of my writeups had some tweaking but to view them you can run `npm
install` and then `npm dev` (note: I used `pnpm` but any package manager should
do)

To view different writeups navigate to `src/pages/index.astro` and modify

```jsx
const entry = await getEntry("posts", "assgn5")
```

to the post you want. Note the typechecker should enforce valid post titles.

If you don't want to build it yourself you can view it (for the timebeing) at the following links
